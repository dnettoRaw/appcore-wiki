# appcore-filemaker

`appcore-filemaker 0.1.0-alpha.1` is the official AppCore deterministic
compiler for declarative documents, vector canvases, and datasets. It is in
source preview and has not been published to crates.io; publication is a
separate maintainer decision.

Strict `filemaker: "1.0"` YAML, typed data, and atomic patches compile to typed
IR. Explicit fonts and assets are measured before fixed-point layout,
geometry-first collision/reflow, and immutable `ResolvedScene` construction.
Inspection, validation, preflight, and the selected exporter consume that scene
without changing geometry.

Collision policy inherits in the explicit document → page → region → group →
element order. YAML accepts `collision: false`, and reflow queries the selected
measured layout, visual, or intrinsic bounds.

Fixed-point transforms support translation, integer-degree rotation, scale,
flip/mirror, and explicit origins. They compose through groups and the same
resolved matrix is consumed by PDF, SVG, PNG/JPEG, and HTML.

Text elements declare layout through `text_options`. Overflow supports `wrap`,
`shrink`, `ellipsis`, `clip`, `expand`, and `error`, with bounded `max_lines`,
absolute `min_font_size`, and fixed-point `line_height`. Measurement and
expansion happen before collision; clipping is resolved geometry; SVG and HTML
render the resolved shaped/truncated runs. Vertical writing and color emoji are
reported as explicit exporter losses until implemented.

Declarative geometry also crosses YAML and IR unchanged. `constraints` carries
minimum, preferred, maximum, and a fixed-point width/height aspect ratio;
`align_x` and `align_y` select start, center, or end in the active container.
Anchors target earlier element edges or named guides with
`guide:name[+offset]`. Contradictory coordinates, ranges, and ratios fail
explicitly. Runtime move/resize patches replace prior positional/sizing intent.

Vertical and horizontal flow containers support `start`, `center`, `end`,
`space_between`, `space_around`, and `space_evenly`. Non-start distribution
requires explicit, preferred, or aspect-derived primary sizes; ambiguous auto
measurement and overflow fail before collision.

Implemented outputs are editable/flattened PDF, SVG, PNG, JPEG, semantic/fixed
HTML, streaming CSV, and PNG/PDF/SVG/JSON debug masks. Prepared modes and nodes
fail explicitly or enter `ExportLossReport`; no silent fallback is allowed.

The deterministic core does not depend on AI. `appcore-filemaker-ai` is an
optional 20-tool bridge over `appcore-ai`; `appcore-filemaker-cli` is the
bounded process adapter. Source examples and exact alpha evidence live in the
Runtime repository on the `beta` branch.
