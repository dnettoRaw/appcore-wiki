# appcore-filemaker

`appcore-filemaker 0.1.0-alpha.1` is the official AppCore deterministic
compiler for declarative documents, vector canvases, and datasets. It is in
source preview and has not been published to crates.io; publication is a
separate maintainer decision.

Strict `filemaker: "1.0"` YAML, typed data, and atomic patches compile to typed
IR. Explicit fonts and assets are measured before fixed-point layout,
geometry-first collision/reflow, and immutable `ResolvedScene` construction.
Inspection, validation, preflight, and the selected exporter consume that scene
without changing geometry.

Collision policy inherits in the explicit document → page → region → group →
element order. YAML accepts `collision: false`, and reflow queries the selected
measured layout, visual, or intrinsic bounds.

Fixed-point transforms support translation, integer-degree rotation, scale,
flip/mirror, and explicit origins. They compose through groups and the same
resolved matrix is consumed by PDF, SVG, PNG/JPEG, and HTML.

Implemented outputs are editable/flattened PDF, SVG, PNG, JPEG, semantic/fixed
HTML, streaming CSV, and PNG/PDF/SVG/JSON debug masks. Prepared modes and nodes
fail explicitly or enter `ExportLossReport`; no silent fallback is allowed.

The deterministic core does not depend on AI. `appcore-filemaker-ai` is an
optional 20-tool bridge over `appcore-ai`; `appcore-filemaker-cli` is the
bounded process adapter. Source examples and exact alpha evidence live in the
Runtime repository on the `beta` branch.
